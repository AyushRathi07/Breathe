LNMhacks Project
According to some reports, lakhs of organs are dumped annually, which when donated to the right people at the right time can save millions of lives. Aiming at this, we are designing a project which will help connect donors, hospitals and recipients. The basic structure of the same is:

1. Hospital Domain - All hospitals according to their region would have their data uploaded including all the reports of the organs and tissues which are available there and for how long they can be kept alive or working and other reports of the same.
2. Donor Domain - Database of donors, where they are located and reports of the corresponding organs/tissues.
3. Recipient Domain - Database of recipients, where they are located and reports of the organs/tissues they need.
